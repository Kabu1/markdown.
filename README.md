# Description
A simple markdown editor with an instant preview and HTML code view. The idea was to have a very simple webapp with two views where the Markdown is entered on the left-hand side and the HTML output is instantly rendered on the right-hand side. So everybody can easily learn Markdown!
I tested this in Chrome and Firefox. I kept the implementation very basic, basically all input is converted after every keypress.
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.1.2.

## SetUp/Installation
To run this application:

$  copy-text-to-clipboard git clone https://github.com/Kabu1/markdown. </copy-button>git clone this repository.

Then run the following in the root of the cloned repository:

$ npm install
// This will install the application dependencies

$ npm start
After the server is running, visit http://localhost:4200 in your browser.
The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
